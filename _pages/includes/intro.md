I am now working on efficient model designing and model compression for LLM. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [jingkun@ahu.edu.cn](mailto:jingkun@ahu.edu.cn). I am currently recruiting master's students. I welcome inquiries from prospective students interested in AI research!

I am currently employed at [School of Internet](https://si.ahu.edu.cn/), [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/).

I received my Ph.D. degree in computer application technology from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://scce.ucas.ac.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in January 2024. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Jungang Xu](http://ccip.ucas.edu.cn/author/%E5%BE%90%E4%BF%8A%E5%88%9A/). I received my B.S. degree in Internet of things engineering from [School of Automation](http://ac.cqupt.edu.cn/), [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

My research interest includes efficient model designing, model compression, LLM, and neural architecture search. I have published 10+ papers at the top international AI journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EtLI2lkAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EtLI2lkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
